Purpose
--------------

PageControl is a simple library that you can use in order to add skinned page controls to your app in either landscape or portrait.  There is the minimum amount of initial configuration required to get it going, then once setup you just set the currentPage like on the standard SDK page control.

Currently this project uses arc.  I can commit or create a non arc version if required.


Installation
--------------

To install PageControl into your app, drag the following files into your project:
 - PageControl.h and .m

See the example app for the basic configuration code to get you started.  This component can be initialised either via a NIB file or in code.
